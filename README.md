# Hetzner K3s - Pythonic


> A collection of functions to setup K3s clusters on [Hetzner Cloud][hcloud], based on vitobotta's [hetzner-k3s][hk3s]

## About

[Hetzner-k3s][hk3s] is nicely engineered general k3s installation tool on Hetzner, with a large degree of declarative possibilities for customization. As terraform, it is a single static binary and idempotent, with a single source of truth. In contrast to terraform it is straightforward to use, with far less abstractions but a lot of built in best practices, incl CNI and autoscaling, plus faster.

This repo here provides a set of **bash functions**, incl. possibly useful support tools to organize them, in order to further automate _around_ the pure k3s installation, which hetzner-k3s provides.


## Features

### Pre K3s Installation

Focus is on creating the cluster with private IPs only, and a _proxy_ server in front of them:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[World] --> B[Bastion Proxy<br/>IP pub<br/>Opt.LoadBalancer]
    B --priv net--> M1[Master 1<br/>...<br/>Master 3]
    B --priv net--> w1[Worker 1<br/>...<br/>Worker n]
    B --priv net--> a1[Autoscaled 1<br/>...<br/>Autoscaled n]
```

That bastion server is the only one with a public IP, and is equipped with a l4 loadbalancer, forwarding the traffic into the cluster, like a hetzner loadbalancer would do.

ðŸ’¡ Using the bastion node as loadbalancer is optional. [hetzner-k3s][hk3s] does by default create hetzner loadbalancers for you, using the hetzner cloud controller manager (ccm).

[Here](./docs/l4lb.md) is a detailed description of the loadbalancer setup, incl. some reasons for it.

---

We provide the functions necessary to

- create the private network
- bastion node itself, with ssh key
- tools (hetzner-k3s, kubectl, helm) and [optional load balancer service](./docs/l4lb.md) on it
- cloud init config for hetzner-k3s, so that the priv ip nodes can reach the internet

Then hetzner-k3s can be run from there, to create the cluster.

### K3s Installation

From the proxy server, we then kick off hetzner-k3s, using a config we synthesized from the environ.

[Here](./docs/privip.md) are the details regarding a private IP only cluster setup.

### Post K3s Installation

We provide functions to

- transfer kubeconfig from the bastion to the local machine
- configure local ssh
- install cert-manager into the cluster
- install ingress-nginx into the cluster
- install services using that ingress into the cluster, in a way so that https traffic from the world can reach the application pods with
  - working certificates
  - optional pod affinity via cookie ("sticky sessions")
  - source ip preservation (using [proxy protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt))
  - autoscaling support

## Usage

In general the script provides its functions after being sourced from a bash script _you_ provide and make executable.

See the ci [../tests/setup.sh](../tests/setup.sh) script for an example, which installs the full cluster from scratch.


ðŸ’¡ When you pass _arguments_ to that script, this results in an execution of the given function and exit of the script, w/o running the subsequent functions after sourcing.


General layout of your script is therefore:

```bash
CONFIGVAR1=CONFIGVAL1
...
source <dir>/main.sh "$@" # exits after execution of any given arguments in $@ (e.g. funcname, params). 
#Otherwise continues with the functions below:
setup_function1
setup_function2
...
```

`yourscript -h` lists all available functions.
